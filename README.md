# terminal-todo-list
A simple terminal-based to-do list.

Its initial target was just to recover my C++ abilities by creating a small CRUD application from scratch, but it may also be useful for someone willing to manage chores with ease via terminal.

### TODO (ironically):
- Save notes at TXT or JSON file for persistent memory;
- Compose prettier user interface;
